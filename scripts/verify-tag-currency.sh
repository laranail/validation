#
# While pre-1.0, laranail packages keep one tag per line and move it, and
# consumers resolve `^0.1` to whatever it currently points at. That makes "the
# tag is on main" an invariant rather than a preference: a tag left behind does
# not mean consumers get older features, it means they get code without the
# fixes.
#
# Two checks, because this package shipped both failures at once.
#
#   1. CURRENCY — the tag consumers resolve must be on main.
#
#      Anchored on `extra.branch-alias`, NOT on the highest tag. That
#      distinction is the whole point of this rewrite. laranail/enumerator
#      carried v0.1.0 through v0.4.0; v0.4.0 pointed at main HEAD, so a check
#      that took the highest tag reported everything healthy — while all nine
#      consumers, every one of them on `^0.1`, resolved v0.1.0 two commits
#      behind and silently missed a preset and an ordering bugfix. `^0.1` on a
#      0.x package means `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`; a v0.4.0 they cannot reach says
#      nothing about what they get.
#
#      The package's own `branch-alias` declares which line is live —
#      `0.1.x-dev` here, `0.7.x-dev` in db-tools — so the check reads it rather
#      than guessing.
#
#   2. REACHABILITY — every tag must be an ancestor of the default branch.
#
#      Composer's VCS driver reads tags, not reachability. This package
#      advertised v0.2.0, v0.2.1 and v0.3.0 pointing at abandoned history, so
#      anyone writing `^0.2` got code that had been discarded months earlier,
#      with nothing anywhere saying so.
#
# Runs against the remote rather than the local checkout, so a stale local tag
# cannot make it pass, and so it needs no particular fetch depth in CI.
#
# Only meaningful pre-1.0. From 1.0 the tag is immutable by design and this
# exits without an opinion.
